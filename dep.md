# Building a Red Teaming Lab with Automated Deployment on AWS and GCP

Red Teaming is an essential practice in offensive security, enabling organizations to simulate real-world attacks and strengthen their defenses. Automating the deployment of a Red Teaming lab in cloud environments like AWS and GCP ensures scalability, repeatability, and efficiency. This guide outlines how to build and automate the deployment of a Red Teaming lab using AWS and GCP services.

---

## **1. Understanding the Purpose of a Red Teaming Lab**

### **What is a Red Teaming Lab?**
A Red Teaming lab is an isolated environment designed to simulate an organizationâ€™s network, enabling:
- Penetration testing practice
- Exploit development
- Advanced persistent threat (APT) simulations
- Security monitoring and defense evasion techniques

### **Key Cloud Services for Deployment**
#### **AWS Services Used:**
- **EC2**: Virtual machines for attack and target machines
- **VPC**: Isolated network infrastructure
- **IAM**: Access control and permissions management
- **S3**: Data storage for logs and payloads
- **CloudFormation**: Infrastructure as code for automated deployment

#### **GCP Services Used:**
- **Compute Engine**: Virtual machines for attack and target environments
- **VPC**: Isolated network setup
- **IAM**: Role-based access control
- **Cloud Storage**: Storing logs and files
- **Deployment Manager**: Automating resource provisioning

## **2. Setting Up the Lab Environment in AWS and GCP**

### **1. AWS Automated Deployment**
Using AWS CloudFormation to deploy an attack machine (Kali Linux) and a target machine:
```yaml
AWSTemplateFormatVersion: '2010-09-09'
Resources:
  RedTeamInstance:
    Type: AWS::EC2::Instance
    Properties:
      InstanceType: t3.medium
      ImageId: ami-0abcdef1234567890  # Kali Linux AMI ID
      SecurityGroups: 
        - !Ref RedTeamSecurityGroup
  RedTeamSecurityGroup:
    Type: AWS::EC2::SecurityGroup
    Properties:
      GroupDescription: Allow SSH and attack tools
      SecurityGroupIngress:
        - IpProtocol: tcp
          FromPort: 22
          ToPort: 22
          CidrIp: 0.0.0.0/0
```
Deploy using:
```bash
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name RedTeamLab --template-body file://redteam.yml
```

### **2. GCP Automated Deployment**
Using GCP Deployment Manager to create an attack VM:
```yaml
resources:
- name: kali-instance
  type: compute.v1.instance
  properties:
    zone: us-central1-a
    machineType: zones/us-central1-a/machineTypes/n1-standard-2
    disks:
    - deviceName: boot
      type: PERSISTENT
      boot: true
      autoDelete: true
      initializeParams:
        sourceImage: projects/kali-linux-cloud/global/images/family/kali-linux
    networkInterfaces:
    - network: global/networks/default
      accessConfigs:
      - name: External NAT
        type: ONE_TO_ONE_NAT
```
Deploy using:
```bash
gcloud deployment-manager deployments create redteam-lab --config redteam.yaml
```

---

## **3. Deploying Red Teaming Tools on Cloud Machines**

### **Installing Red Teaming Tools**
```bash
sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y kali-linux-full
```
Essential tools:
- **C2 Frameworks**: Cobalt Strike, Empire, Sliver
- **Post-Exploitation**: Metasploit, Mimikatz, BloodHound
- **Scanning**: Nmap, Shodan, Amass, FOCA
- **Privilege Escalation**: LinPEAS, WinPEAS
- **Evasion Techniques**: AMSI Bypass, AV Evasion, LOLBAS

---

## **4. Automating Red Team Exercises in AWS and GCP**

### **1. Using Terraform for Multi-Cloud Deployment**
```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-east-1"
}
provider "google" {
  credentials = file("gcp-key.json")
  project     = "redteam-lab"
  region      = "us-central1"
}
resource "aws_instance" "redteam_aws" {
  ami           = "ami-0abcdef1234567890"
  instance_type = "t3.medium"
}
resource "google_compute_instance" "redteam_gcp" {
  name         = "redteam-gcp"
  machine_type = "n1-standard-2"
  zone         = "us-central1-a"
}
```
Deploy using:
```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

### **2. Automating Adversary Simulations with Caldera**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mitre/caldera.git
cd caldera && pip install -r requirements.txt
python server.py --insecure
```

---

## **5. Monitoring and Logging in AWS and GCP**

### **AWS Logging & SIEM**
- **CloudTrail**: Monitor API actions
- **CloudWatch Logs**: Store attack activity logs
- **AWS Security Hub**: Aggregate security findings

### **GCP Logging & Monitoring**
- **Cloud Logging**: Store and analyze logs
- **Cloud Security Command Center**: Detect and respond to security threats

---

## **6. Conclusion: Enhancing Automated Red Teaming in the Cloud**

By leveraging AWS and GCP services, security teams can automate the deployment and execution of Red Teaming labs at scale. Using Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform, CloudFormation, and Deployment Manager ensures repeatable and efficient lab setups.
