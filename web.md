# Starting Point: A Comprehensive Guide to CTF Reconnaissance

CTF (Capture The Flag) competitions often begin with one crucial phase: **reconnaissance**. Before attempting any exploits, gathering information about the target is essential. This guide covers different types of reconnaissance techniques for Web, Network, Linux, and Windows-based challenges.

---

## **1. Web Reconnaissance**

### **Checking `robots.txt` and Sitemap**
Many websites include a `robots.txt` file that disallows search engines from indexing certain pages. These can reveal sensitive endpoints:

```bash
curl -s http://target-website.com/robots.txt
```

Similarly, a `sitemap.xml` may list accessible pages:

```bash
curl -s http://target-website.com/sitemap.xml
```

### **Directory Enumeration**
Finding hidden directories can lead to exposed admin panels or backup files. Use `gobuster`:

```bash
gobuster dir -u http://target-website.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

### **Finding Subdomains**
Subdomains often host test or staging environments that may have vulnerabilities:

```bash
subfinder -d target-website.com
```

Or use `amass` for a more in-depth scan:

```bash
amass enum -passive -d target-website.com
```

### **Identifying Technologies**
Knowing the tech stack can help determine potential vulnerabilities:

```bash
whatweb http://target-website.com
```

```bash
wappalyzer -url target-website.com
```

### **Web Fuzzing**
Fuzzing helps identify unexpected responses and hidden parameters:

```bash
ffuf -u http://target-website.com/FUZZ -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt
```

## **2. Network Reconnaissance**

### **Scanning Open Ports**
Checking for open ports can reveal exposed services:

```bash
nmap -sC -sV -p- target-ip
```

To scan for vulnerabilities:

```bash
nmap --script=vuln target-ip
```

### **Enumerating Services**
If SMB is open:

```bash
smbclient -L \\target-ip\ -U anonymous
```

If FTP is open:

```bash
ftp target-ip
```

### **Packet Capture Analysis**
If you have access to a network packet capture file:

```bash
tshark -r capture.pcap
```

Use Wireshark to analyze traffic and search for credentials.

## **3. Linux Reconnaissance**

### **Finding SUID Binaries**
Some binaries allow privilege escalation:

```bash
find / -perm -4000 2>/dev/null
```

### **Checking for Weak Permissions**

```bash
ls -la /home/
```

Look for misconfigured files that allow unintended access.

### **Cracking Hashes**
If password hashes are found:

```bash
hashcat -m 0 hashes.txt /usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt --force
```

---

## **4. Windows Reconnaissance**

### **Enumerating Users and Shares**
Checking for accessible shares:

```powershell
net view \\target-ip
```

Finding user accounts:

```powershell
net user /domain
```

### **Checking Running Processes**
Sometimes sensitive processes reveal credentials:

```powershell
tasklist /v
```

### **Finding Misconfigured Services**

```powershell
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode
```

Look for writable services that can be exploited for privilege escalation.

## **Conclusion**

Reconnaissance is the most critical phase in any CTF challenge. Without a solid understanding of the target, exploitation becomes much harder. By using a combination of web, network, Linux, and Windows recon techniques, you can gather valuable intelligence to gain an edge in solving challenges.

ðŸš€ Keep learning and happy hacking!
