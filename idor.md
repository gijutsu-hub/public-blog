# Starting Point: A Comprehensive Guide to IDOR Reconnaissance

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is a common web application vulnerability that allows attackers to access unauthorized resources by modifying object references. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to reconnaissance techniques for identifying and exploiting IDOR vulnerabilities.

---

## **1. Understanding IDOR**

### **What is IDOR?**
IDOR occurs when applications expose object identifiers (such as user IDs, transaction IDs, or file references) without proper access controls. Attackers manipulate these references to access unauthorized data.

### **Common IDOR Targets**
- User profiles (`/profile?id=123`)
- Order history (`/order?id=456`)
- Payment transactions (`/payment?id=789`)
- Private messages (`/message?id=101112`)

---

## **2. Reconnaissance for IDOR**

### **Identifying IDOR Parameters**
Monitor requests using a proxy tool like Burp Suite:

1. **Capture and analyze all API requests**
2. **Look for sequential or predictable identifiers**
3. **Test by modifying object references**

Example:
```http
GET /user/profile?id=123 HTTP/1.1
Host: target-website.com
```
Modify `id=123` to `id=124` and observe the response.

### **Checking for User Authorization Bypass**
Use multiple test accounts with different privilege levels:
- Admin vs Regular User
- Logged-in User vs Guest

Example:
```http
GET /admin/settings HTTP/1.1
```
Attempt to access restricted endpoints without authentication.

### **Brute-Forcing Object IDs**
Use `ffuf` to enumerate valid object IDs:

```bash
ffuf -u http://target-website.com/user/profile?id=FUZZ -w wordlist.txt
```

Check for responses with different status codes (200 OK, 403 Forbidden, etc.).

## **3. Exploiting IDOR**

### **Exploiting User Profile Information**
If user profiles are accessible without proper authorization:
```http
GET /user/profile?id=9999 HTTP/1.1
```
You may retrieve another userâ€™s personal details.

### **Tampering with Sensitive Transactions**
If modifying payment transaction IDs grants unauthorized access:
```http
GET /payment/confirm?transaction_id=12345 HTTP/1.1
```
Modify `transaction_id=12345` to `transaction_id=12346` to confirm another user's payment.

### **Accessing Private Messages**
If private messages are exposed via predictable IDs:
```http
GET /message?id=5555 HTTP/1.1
```
Change the ID to access someone elseâ€™s message.

---

## **4. Preventing IDOR**

### **Implement Proper Access Controls**
- Validate user permissions on every request
- Use session-based authentication

### **Use Secure Object References**
Instead of exposing sequential IDs:
```http
GET /user/profile?id=3f4b2a9d
```
Use random or hashed identifiers.

### **Monitor Logs for Unauthorized Access**
Regularly audit access logs for suspicious activity.

## **Conclusion**

IDOR vulnerabilities are prevalent in web applications and can lead to severe data breaches. By performing thorough reconnaissance, testing for authorization flaws, and exploiting weak access controls, attackers can uncover critical security gaps.
